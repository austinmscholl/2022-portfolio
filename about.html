                            <h5>Beginning</h5>
                            <p>
                                I began my journey into the world of programming in August of 2016. At the advice of a friend, I started a JavaScript course on codeacademy.com. I then moved on to SQL, Java, Python, and every other free course I could find.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After learning from codeacademy for a few months, I transitioned to Udemy courses, as well as other web resources. My friend suggested that if I learned C# development, I could potentially work at his company, sugra-sym.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In June of 2017, I began my career in technology at sugra-sym, a C#/.NET custom software shop based out of Indianapolis, IN.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After approximately 10 months of online courses, working with a small startup doing Xamarin development felt like being thrown into the deep end of the pool. It was a tremendous learning opportunity, one for which I am very thankful. I got to develop with extremely talented individuals, work on cool products, and gain experience with tools like Redgate, LINQ, MSSQL, WordPress, and Microsoft Visual Studio.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I walked away from the experience realizing that I wanted to receive formal training in software development. I enrolled in a Computer Science program at Ivy Tech.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I had previously researched Eleven Fifty Academy, a coding bootcamp in Fishers, Indiana, and was connected with a recruiter on LinkedIn. Several months after enrolling in Ivy Tech, I saw a post about a scholarship I qualified for at Eleven Fifty and enrolled immediately!
                            </p>

                            <h5>Eleven Fifty Academy</h5>
                            <p>
                                Eleven Fifty Academy is a non-profit coding bootcamp based in Fishers, IN. Their curriculum includes .NET, Python, and JavaScript technology stacks. I attended a fullstack JavaScript program from August 2018 through November 2018.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The 3-month program begins with pre-work, to be completed before we actually begin. The pre-work consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Much of the pre-work is reviewed in the first 3 weeks, also known as "Gold Badge".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After Gold Badge, those who qualify are graduated to the next level, which is "Blue Badge". Blue Badge consisted of learning React.js and Node.js through lectures, exercises, Gitbooks, Official Documentation, Stack Overflow, and our fellow students. Throughout this period, my class of almost 30 students leaned on each other heavily and developed more than just software([insert joke about human relationships and bonding])...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I developed the Getstruments web application for my Blue Badge project. As a musician, the idea of using technology to resource-share music equipment, like AirBnB for guitars, seemed perfect. I am proud of this project because it was the first full CRUD application I built by myself, beginning to end.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Following Blue Badge, those who meet the requirements are advanced to the next stage. Red Badge is focused on cultivating your team-development skills. During Red Badge, my team and I built two Single-Page Applications(SPAs) using Angular 2+, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. We also used Agile methodology, GitHub, Slack, and Trello. I graduated from Eleven Fifty Academy in November of 2018.
                            </p>

                            <h5>AAES, Freelance, &amp; Pathfinder</h5>
                            <p>
                                Eleven Fifty Academy is full of brilliant individuals. I was lucky enough to briefly form a startup with 3 of them. AAES Software was a group we formed to solve a very specific pain point in the medical industry. We prototyped a mobile application using React-Native, Expo, and MaterialUI.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to working with AAES, I started Unfolding Software LLC. I currently offer freelance development services for Salesforce.com, Looker, AWS, JavaScript, Web Development, and more. Please contact me today if you are looking for a talented developer on a contract basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As an EFA Alumni, I gained access to the Salesforce Pathfinder program. Salesforce is partnering with Deloitte to introduce Developers and Administrators into the global Salesforce ecosystem. The program, which is about 12 weeks long, consists of online Trailhead content, in-person events and training, webinars, and a case study. As part of the Developer track, I worked with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Lightning, Salesforce Classic, Apex, Aura Components, Visualforce, and Lightning Web Components. I obtained my PD1(Platform Developer I) certification a few weeks after graduating.
                            </p>

                            <h5>OpenMartech.ci &amp; Today</h5>
                            <p>
                                In April of 2019 I began working remotely with Indianapolis-based startup, OpenMartech. OpenMartech is using AI and Machine Learning to revolutionize the marketing industry. In my role as a Data Science intern, I use the Looker platform to create reports, dashboards, and custom data visualizations for our clients. Additionally, I am developing on the AWS Platform with Python, Lambda, EC2, API Gateway, CloudWatch, and Amazon Redshift.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Towards the end of June 2019 I obtained my Salesforce Platform Developer I certification. In August 2019, I became a Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner. I have since added Salesforce Administrator, Salesforce Sales Cloud Consultant, ITIL 4 Foundations, HubSpot Inbound Sales, CompTIA ITF+, and CompTIA Network+ certifications to my repertoire. I am currently working towards my Bachelors degree in WGU's Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program.

                                I am currently seeking full-time employment. Please contact me today if you are looking to add a talented developer to your team!
